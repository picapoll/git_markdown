# Git basics

## Init a repositori

To initialize a repositori we have to use the command `git init`
This command will create a hiden `.git` sub-folder in the project folder

## track first changes

First time our files are *untracked*

to start tracking our files we have to `commit` them.

Gor example, if we have and `index.htm` created we can start tracking it by doing...
```
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "first commit"
```
